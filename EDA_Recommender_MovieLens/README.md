# **Project Description**

This is a classification machine learning project to estimate the precise number of occupants in a room using multiple non-intrusive environmental sensors like temperature, light, sound, CO2 and PIR (passive infrared censor).
Performed multiple classification models, such as K-NN, XGBoost, Random Forest, LDA, QDA, Decision Tree classifier, and more. 
Further performed model selection based on accuracy metrics.
